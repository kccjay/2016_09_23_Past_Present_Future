  <h2>My Past</h2>
  <img class="right" src="gaffneypeach.jpg" alt="the gaffney peach">
  <p>I was born on August 23, 2001 in greenville SC I was originally supposed to be born on the 5th of august I was two weeks late. We did not stay long in greenville about to 2 years after I was born my sister was born and that was when we started to leave in gaffney we stayed in gaffney for about 4 years. In gaffney we spent my kindergarten years (2) at that I didn't even know what greenville was when I turned 6 we moved to greenville and went to <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/cherry/">Cherrydale elementary </a> that was for 1st grade. Then I switched schools about 6 months into my first grade year, I believe the school I went to was oakview. We were only in greenville for 1 year then we moved back done to gaffney and I spent a majority of my elementary years in gaffney, that was only for about 3 years. In that 3 years I had made friends and I actually knew them over time, even that was short lived because we moved back to greenville on my 5th grade year. I didnâ€™t know or remember anyone, my 5th grade year past and my middle school year.  </p>

  <h2>My Present</h2>
  <img class="left" src="jlmann.jpg" alt="the jl mann high school logo">
<p>2016 it's been five years since we moved back in greenville and my family is staying indefinitely at least till I finish my last 3 years of high school. Right now my family is helping me learn how to drive, because I got my permit a month ago and I have a year till I can legally take the road test so they want me to pass on the first try. My focus is to keep my grades up but another is to have a good plan for my future. I go to <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/jlmann/"> JL Mann high school </a> I'm a "patriot", my 9th grade was decent although I never experienced "traditional"  since I'm in new tech. New tech is basically to help more with preparing for college, this program focuses more on oral communication, collaboration, written communication. This is needed for college many people have to learn this on  their on and it can be difficult. My high school years would teach me little more than normal high school classes.</p>

  <h2>My Future</h2>
<img src="hireengineers.jpeg" alt="a circuit board with toy workers">
<p>2019 and on I would be controlling my life from that point. 2019 is my graduation year after that no more school. My career would be in software engineering something I can work hard for and it turn out great. My family would continue to do what they do many of my cousins would still be in <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/">school </a>. In the future I would help my family out on my free time taking my cousins to schools and helping them with their homework because I know I would forget the small things taught to me so thats a good refresher. For the remainder of the time I would work at a job to have money to pay for school and just to have in my pocket just in case I see something I need or want. From what I know about my classes I would be the youngest to graduate in all my classes in 2019.</p>
